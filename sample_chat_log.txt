Jason: You know what, Allen? I’m honestly tired of you acting like the victim all the time.

Allen: What are you talking about? I’ve literally just been trying to keep the peace.

Jason: That’s exactly it. You always play innocent, but you’re the one who starts drama behind everyone’s back.

Allen: Bro, I don’t even talk to people like that. Why are you attacking me right now?

Jason: Don’t act confused. You know what you did. And if you really cared about this friendship, you’d stop lying for once.

Allen: I haven’t lied about anything, man. You’re twisting stuff again.

Jason: No, I’m just done pretending you’re not toxic. Everyone sees it but you.

Allen: This is coming out of nowhere. Can we just talk about this like normal people?

Jason: Don’t gaslight me, Allen. You always make yourself the victim to avoid responsibility.

Allen: I’m not gaslighting you. I’m literally asking what you’re mad about.

Jason: If you don’t know, then maybe you’re more messed up than I thought.

Allen: Are you serious right now?

Jason: You always ruin everything. You ruin groups, you ruin vibes, you ruin people. I’m done trying to fix things with someone who’s broken.
